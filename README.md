# Student Grading System
This is my first assignment for my Introduction to Programming class.
The program simulates a grading system for a class of students by generating random student names and grades, calculating their final grades, and displaying class statistics.

## Features
- Generate random names and grades for students.
- Calculate final grades based on weighted averages.
- Assign letter grades based on final grades.
- Display class statistics including average grade, standard deviation, highest and lowest grades, and the count of students in each letter grade category.
